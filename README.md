# epÂ² - encrypted P2P [online & offline]

>

**_ep2_** is a Typescript library that provides secure **`peer-to-peer`** communication between browsers, both **_`online`_** and **_`offline`_**.

It uses the [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js) library for hybrid encryption and signature verification between online peers using [peerjs](https://github.com/peers), and the [web-push](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push) library for encrypted push messaging between offline peers.

## Getting started

To try out ep2, you can clone the project and start an example server and client using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bosskabouter/ep2.git
cd ep2
npm i
npm start
```
